sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Fastest overall for "sorted" text file types. Does not follow an exponential curve under best case scenario as n increases and is best representative of omega(n) in this test environment.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Fastest for "random" text file types. More importantly, most closely follows a logarithmic curve as n increases within each for the three text file types.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Faster than sort1 for â€œreversed" textfile types and most closely resembles an exponential curve across all three textfile types which resembles O(n^2).
